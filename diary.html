            <h2><b>April 4, 2021.</b></h2>
            <p>Fixed some code on this page and added a downloadable portfolio of my recent design work. For the past month or so I've
              been learning Javascript intensively, both on the front-end and the back-end. The latter is very complex to me but the more
              I get into it, it gets more interesting and I think it really helps me get a fuller picture of what I'm dealing with. <br><br>
              I've been trying to get a clear understanding of how things function today on the server-side and there's a lot to catch up with. <br>
              REST arhitecture, JWT, serverless computing just to name a few concepts. There are many learning resources available online but I find it's not so easy to
              find an article or tutorial that explains things well. What works best for me is combining multiple resources and writing my own
              notes, but I will say that <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials' target='_blank'><b>DigitalOcean</b></a> and <a href='https://medium.com/' target='_blank'><b>Medium</b></a> 
              usually have really good, beginner-friendly articles that explain things thoroughly. <br><br>
              I'm also trying to balance theory and code practice so I've been putting aside design work for a while...

              <h2><b>March 3, 2021.</b></h2>
              <p>So lately I've been working on a few designs in Figma. I like it a lot as it is a very powerful and easy to use tool. 
              You can see them in the <a href='https://tasteslikestrawberries.github.io/portfolio.html' target='_blank'><b>Portfolio</b></a> section and on my
              <a href='https://dribbble.com/tasteslikestrawberries' target='_blank'><b>Dribble</b></a> profile. I'm trying to balance designing and coding because
               I really enjoy both and there is so much to learn. Currently I'm trying to teach myself Javascript and it hasn't been easy as I don't have any real programming
               skills, except making websites with HTML and CSS (which I think doesn't really count as programming). But it's a huge challenge and I'm not planning to give up easily.
               Also, I've been thinking of writing more about my learning process here and writing more in general. We'll see, maybe this site needs a little reorganisation :))</p>
